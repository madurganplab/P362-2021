    "Jupyter notebooks provide a natural way to create numerical programming and data science logbooks. Code and text blocks allow for a natural analysis or data taking flow without requiring the typical structure needed for software oriented programming. While Jupyter's first iteration was based on Markdown for text and Python code, it currently supports all data science programming languages. In this course we will utuilize the Julia programming language thanks to its clear and simple syntax combined with fast execution."
